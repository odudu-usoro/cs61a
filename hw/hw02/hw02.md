QUESTION 1
What the Code Does
Start with 1:
The code starts by setting total = 1. This is because multiplying by 1 doesn’t change anything, so it’s a safe starting point for our product.

Go Through Each Number:
The for loop runs through all the numbers from 1 to n (including n).

For each number i, it calculates the term at that position using the term(i) function.
It multiplies total by this term to update the product.
Give Back the Product:
After the loop finishes, the total now holds the product of all the terms from term(1) to term(n).
The return total line sends this result back so we can use it.

How It Solves the Problem
The goal is to multiply the first n terms of a sequence, where each term is given by the term function. Here’s how the code solves that:

It starts with a product of 1.

This makes sure the first multiplication works correctly.
It uses a loop to calculate every term in the sequence (term(1), term(2), ..., term(n)) and multiplies them together step by step.

For example, if n = 3 and term(i) = i, the code does:
total = 1 * term(1) → 1 * 1 = 1
total = 1 * term(2) → 1 * 2 = 2
total = 2 * term(3) → 2 * 3 = 6
When the loop finishes, it has multiplied all the terms together, so the answer is ready in total.

This simple step-by-step process ensures that the code solves the problem exactly as the question asks.
